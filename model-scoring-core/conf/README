In the examples directory you can find application.conf.tpl file 
that has configurations you might want to configure outside of the packaged jar.
If you feel like it's important for customers to know about the configuration please add it here with a comment. 
This is the template configuration file that is shipped out to customers.
If you know what a configuration does please add a comment about its function.

EXERCISE CAUTION WHEN UPDATING application.conf.tpl because you might break the post installation script. the following
properties get search replaced with relevant data from Cloudera manager by
atk/package/config/trustedanalytics/assets/etc/trustedanalytics/rest-server/config.py
    fs.root
    spark.master
    spark.executor.memory


PLEASE
	comments should start with a pound #
	commented config that can be enabled should start with //
	
	a good example would be
	
	fs {
	  # the system will create an "trustedanalytics" folder at this location, if set,
      # or at the root of the filesystem, if not. All Trusted Analytics Toolkit files will
      # be stored somehwere under that base location.
      #
      # For example, if using HDFS, set the root to hdfs path
      # root = "hdfs://MASTER_HOSTNAME/some/path"
      #
      # If running in local mode, this might be a better choice:
	  //root = ${user.home}
	  
	  #Host name must be a fully qualified domain
      //root = "hdfs://master/user/hadoop"
	}

to use the base config copy it and rename to the conf directory

cp atk/conf/examples/application.conf.tpl atk/conf/examples/application.conf

application.conf is being ignored by git so no worries about commiting in by mistake
